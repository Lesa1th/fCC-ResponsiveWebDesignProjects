            <h3>Here's a timeline of the Countess of Lovelace's life</h3>
            <ul id="timeline-list">
                <li><b>1815</b> - Ada Lovelace was born on December 10, 1815, in London, England. She was the daughter of the famous poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke. Ada was raised primarily by her mother, who encouraged her interest in mathematics and science to keep her away from her father's "instability."</li>
                <li><b>1828</b> - At the age of 12, Ada began to show a keen interest in mathematics and science, which was unusual for a young woman of her social standing at the time. She was educated at home by tutors, including the mathematician Augustus De Morgan.</li>
                <li><b>1833</b> - At the age of 17, in June 1833, Ada was introduced to Charles Babbage, the inventor of the concept of the Analytical Engine, a mechanical calculating machine that could be programmed to perform various mathematical operations. This meeting was pivotal for Ada's future in science.</li>
                <li><b>1835</b> - Ada married William King in 1835, becoming the Countess of Lovelace. She had three children but continued her mathematical studies with the support of tutors.</li>
                <li><b>1842-1843</b> - Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated into English a paper by Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Babbage's Analytical Engine. While translating, she included a set of personal notes that were published and ended up being three times longer than the original article. In these notes, Ada introduced concepts recognized as the foundation of modern computing, including the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine (an early form of programming).</li>
                <li><b>1843</b> - In her notes, Ada was the first to realize that the Analytical Engine could be used to manipulate symbols, not just numbers, envisioning applications like music composition and graphical representation. This visionary insight was far ahead of her time, as it highlighted the possibility that machines could do much more than mere mathematical calculations.</li>
                <li><b>1852</b> - Ada Lovelace died of uterine cancer on November 27, 1852, at the age of 36. She was buried next to her father, Lord Byron, in Hucknall, England.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
            <ul id="key-contributions-list">
                <li><b>First Algorithm</b>: Ada is recognized as the first computer programmer, as her notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine contained the first algorithm that could be processed by a machine.</li>
                <li><b>Vison of Universal Computing</b>: She foresaw that calculating machines could be used for much more than mathematics, imagining future applications in fields like music, art, and science.</li>
            </ul>
